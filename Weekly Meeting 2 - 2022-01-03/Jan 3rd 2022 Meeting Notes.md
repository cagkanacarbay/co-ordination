## Meeting Notes
We start by catching up after the holidays. Everyone’s getting COVID these days :(

Dimitri Fernando - The first proposal 
- A tropical disease dengue fever in Sri Lanka, 
- Papaya leaves cures this disease, it tastes very bad

Ryan Vukich

### Considerations by Özgür
- Do we have enough time to collect proposals?
- Can we collect enough time?
- Conflict of interest on the core team if we’re allowed to propose

### Some Clarifications on the First Cycle

First donation cycle is a proof of concept. Details such as the proof of evidence, and guidance on types of proposals are left unclear on purpose. These details will become more clear as we perform the next cycles

For the first cycle, we’ll spend the entire fund. If any remains out of the max cap donation of 1000 ADA, we’ll decide on a runner up in the vote meeting that will get the remaining.

First cycle NFTs will be ready by the proposal vote (Hopefully). We’ll use ready NFT tools to mint these NFTs: https://cardano-native-token.com/. We have to develop a way to collect donator addresses to mint NFTs. 

### Future

How do we establish a continual, sustainable donations platform?
- Long term: Build treasury, invest, donate returns, expand treasury. 
- Mid term: SPOs, NFTs, Token

Tokens as a tool to generate funding, as rewards for donating, proposing, validating. Circle economy with tokens being spent on green goods and services.

NFTs as a way to show off your donations, proposals, validations, as social rewards (badge of honor)

Timeline considerations: Can we get 1000ADA by the time of donation? Let’s keep dates as is for now. We’ll reconsider next week based on the state of our donations.

## Outcomes

Finish flier by tomorrow to promote the first donation process
- Share proposal forms in Discord channels, Twitter, Cardano4Climate
- NFTs for the first cycle. We got to get working on an implementation.
- Breakout room after townhall on Wednesday
- Set agenda beforehand for the next meeting

22:36:25 From Dimitri Fernando To Everyone:
    Start the process of pet food production using a vehicle to pickup the Waste from Slaughterhouse on a regular basis and cook it and make Petfood. I would use this to purchase cookers and put a cover on a vehicle in order  to cook the Petfood on a regular basis, convert it into Petfood and either sell it to make the operation sustainable or if sustained by donations would donate part of it to animal shelters who depend on donations to feed the stray dogs. This would reduce Animal Waste Garbage from this slaughterhouse significantly, Reduce spread of disease from this waste being in the garbage dump, reduce CO2 emission from this waste, and also feed animals at the same time, who otherwise would starve.
    
1000 ADA will be used to put purchase cookers in order to do the cooking of the Slaughter waste ( Chicken parts which are otherwise discarded)  . Additional Funds from IDeascale would be used to put a Canopy on a vehicle which is currently transporting this waste . This would require about 10,000 ADA to do .The
